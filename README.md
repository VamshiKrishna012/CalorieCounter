The Calorie Counter is a simple web-based application that helps users track their daily calorie intake and expenditure. Users can set a daily calorie budget, log food intake for different meals, and track calories burned through exercise. The app then calculates the remaining calories and displays whether the user is in a calorie surplus or deficit.

🚀 Features
